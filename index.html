									<p>For a person who likes to see people through colours I guess I give l you a faint blue ...cause you remind me of white but as you like blue I could add a hint of it ..white for me is a colour that goes with everything ..it sends the most positive and peaceful vibes and yet mysterious in its own ways. A colour that is in trend and a colour no one hates . A colour that will stand out in the dark and bright . A colour I would always love . You are a sky/light  blue / the blue closer to white  to me ,besti(t)e. Just cannot imagine my two years without you, the support and the fun and conspiracies .loving my cats though  you hate animals ..nobody does that ...respecting my passions and as usual being a bish with me . I give you all my louve !‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è</p>

									<p>HAPPIEST BDAY pyscho. 
										You're innocence and chirpiness keeps our friendship going. Your approach towards all your relationships with people inspires me and how you continue to strengthen and nurture them. You're honestly one of the sweetest and purest souls I've met and hopefully will always be. (No, not hopefully, definitely). I'll love you endlessly and I'm always going to be here for you. Above all. MEET ME FFS WHAT ARE THESE CLASSES. So much to tell you! Ily‚ù§-Diya</p>
